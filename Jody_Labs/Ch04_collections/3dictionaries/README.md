# Chapter 4: Lab 3 Dictionary

## Objectives

* Practice using Dictionary

## Overview:

You will create and work with dictionary.

## Steps

### View Unique Values in a set

1. In your MyPython project folder, in the folder Ch04, create a new file called **dictionary_practice.py**. 

2. In the created file, create this dictionary and then print it. Run your code to see the output.
   
    ![print program](../screenshots/3-squares.png)

3. Continue with the following steps running your code to see the output.
   

4. Get all keys and values by calling items(). Use a for loop to display the data. 
   
    ![print program](../screenshots/3-items-loop.png)

5. You can remove an item using pop() by passing it the key of the item to remove. 
   
    ![print program](../screenshots/3-pop.png)

6. Add a new square using square brackets and the assignment operator.

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-add.png)

7. If you use popitem() it removes the last added item. Do this now and print the output.

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-pop-item.png)

8. Delete an item using bracket notation. 

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-delete-bracket.png)

9.  Delete an item using bracket notation but give an invalid value. Try to run the program and view the error message. Then comment out this new del.

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-delete-bracket-error.png)

10. Remove all items in dictionary by using clear()

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-clear.png)   


11. Remove the entire dictionary using del. Try to print and see the error. Then comment out the print.

    ![print program](../screenshots/3-del-dict.png)    




## Bonus

1. Use code to generate a dictionary that has the keys 1 to 10 - and their values are 3 times the amount of the key.

    Use a for loop with items() to get the keys and values. Print am understandable display of the data.
